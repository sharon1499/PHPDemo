<p>This is the temporary <b>home</b> page on <b>Bumblebess</b>. Throughout this website you will be given a quick overview of myself and a few facts on bumblebees.<b>Bumblebees</b> are a well known insect across the global. Like myself some may like them for not only their cute fluffiness and colors but also for how important they are for out plants or flowers. As you can see of the picture below their colors consist of yellow and black. However, their looks are not their only goof value. If you look at the menu bar you wil see a facts option. If you click that option you will be redirected to that page where I will give you a few facts on bumblebees. </p>
